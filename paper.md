# Introduction

We present a biologically plausible model of processing intrinsic to the basal
ganglia based on the computational premise that action selection is a primary
role of these central brain structures. By encoding the propensity for
selecting a given action in a scalar value (the salience), it is shown that
action selection may be recast in terms of signal selection. The generic
properties of signal selection are defined and neural networks for this type of
computation examined. A comparison between these networks and basal ganglia
anatomy leads to a novel functional decomposition of the basal ganglia
architecture into selection and control path-ways. The former pathway performs
the selection per se via a feedforward off-centre on-surround network. The
control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure its
effective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic
modulation. The model contrasts with the prevailing functional segregation of
basal ganglia into direct and indirect pathways.\
\
In a companion paper a new functional architecture was proposed for the basal
ganglia based on the premise that these brain structures play a central role in
behavioural action selection. The current paper quantitatively describes the
properties of the model using analysis and simulation. The decomposition of the
basal ganglia into selection and control pathways is supported in several
ways. First, several elegant features are exposed — capacity scaling, enhanced
selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation — which might be expected to
exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these
features also lends support to the computational premise of selection that
underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus
external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and substantia
nigra reticulata area output, and neu- rophysiological data, have been found
which are indicative of common architectural features in the model and
biological basal ganglia. Third, the behaviour of the model as a signal
selection mechanism has parallels with some kinds of action selection observed
in animals under various levels of dopaminergic modulation.
