abstract: "We propose a reference implementation of “Interaction between
  cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops during decision making: a
  computational study”, M. Guthrie, A. Leblois, A. Garenne, and T. Boraud,
  Journal of Neurophysiology, 109(12), 2013 that introduces an action selection
  mechanism in cortico-basal ganglia loops based on a competition between the
  positive feed- back, direct pathway through the striatum and the negative
  feedback, hyperdirect pathway through the subthalamic nucleus. The original
  implementation was made in Delphi (Object Pascal) whose sources are available
  on request to any of the author of the original article. We have used these
  sources to disambiguate ambiguous and missing information in the original
  article. The reference implementation we propose has been coded in Python for
  ease of reading and Cython for performances because the main result includes
  a batch of 250 experiments over 120 trials that would be too slow for regular
  Python scripts."
