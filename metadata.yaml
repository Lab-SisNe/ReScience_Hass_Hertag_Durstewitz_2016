abstract: "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in planning, decision making, working memory, emotional modulation and social behaviour. Hass and colleagues developed a model of the PFC with physiological validity and predictive capability at the single neuron and network levels, in MATLAB, available on ModelDB. In this work we reimplemented the model using Python and the Brian 2 simulator, and discuss some aspects that were not explicitly specified in the original work."
