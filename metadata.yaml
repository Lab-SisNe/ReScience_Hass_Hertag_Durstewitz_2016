# Abstract. don't forget to surround it with double quotes
abstract: "This article is a proposition for a new article template for both
  the ReScience C (computational replication) and the upcoming ReScience X
  (experimental replication) journals. It is loosely based after
  Edward Tufte’s book style where the large left column contains the main text
  and the right column is used for auxiliary informations such as notes,
  captions or references. The template requires a standard TeXLive installation
  in order to compile it and this PDF has been compiled using TeXLive 2017
  (pdflatex). Both the style, the layout and the colors of the template aim at
  giving ReScience a strong but subtle identity."
