**[Re] Interaction between cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops during decision making: a computational study**, M. Topalidou and N.P. Rougier, ReScience 1(#1), 2015.

**Abstract.** We propose a reference implementation of “Interaction between cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops during decision making: a computational study”, M. Guthrie, A. Leblois, A. Garenne, and T. Boraud, Journal of Neurophysiology, 109(12), 2013 that introduces an action selection mechanism in cortico-basal ganglia loops based on a competition between the positive feed- back, direct pathway through the striatum and the negative feedback, hyperdirect pathway through the subthalamic nucleus. The original implementation was made in Delphi (Object Pascal) whose sources are available on request to any of the author of the original article. We have used these sources to disambiguate ambiguous and missing information in the original article. The reference implementation we propose has been coded in Python for ease of reading and Cython for performances because the main result includes a batch of 250 experiments over 120 trials that would be too slow for regular Python scripts.

**Keywords:** python, computational neuroscience
