**Abstract.** We propose a reference implementation of “Interaction between
cognitive and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops during decision making: a
computational study”, M. Guthrie, A. Leblois, A. Garenne, and T. Boraud,
Journal of Neurophysiology, 109(12), 2013 that introduces an action selection
mechanism in cortico-basal ganglia loops based on a competition between the
positive feed- back, direct pathway through the striatum and the negative
feedback, hyperdirect pathway through the subthalamic nucleus. The original
implementation was made in Delphi (Object Pascal) whose sources are available
on request to any of the author of the original article. We have used these
sources to disambiguate ambiguous and missing information in the original
article. The reference implementation we propose has been coded in Python for
ease of reading and Cython for performances because the main result includes a
batch of 250 experiments over 120 trials that would be too slow for regular
Python scripts.
